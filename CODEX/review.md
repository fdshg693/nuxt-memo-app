# Code Review

## Build & Project Structure
- `npm run build` succeeds, but there are no lint or test scripts defined in `package.json`. Consider adding ESLint and unit tests for better quality control.
- `.nuxt` directory is excluded via `.gitignore` and not tracked, which is correct.
- A file named `3.x.x` exists at the repository root. It appears to contain the output of `nuxi` help and is probably not needed in version control.

## Components & Pages
- Many Vue components are concise but lack type annotations for props (e.g., `DatabaseTable.vue` uses `any`). Defining proper interfaces would improve readability and IDE support.
- Several components (e.g., `SqlEditor.vue`) emit events with generic names. Consider using [defineEmits](https://nuxt.com) with more explicit types.
- The `global-css.ts` plugin only imports a CSS file and returns an empty plugin. You can remove the plugin and import the CSS via `nuxt.config.ts` (`css` option) to simplify.
- Some `.vue` files do not end with a newline. Ensuring newline at EOF avoids diff noise.

## Composables
- In `useSqlDb.ts` and other composables, return types are largely `any`. Adding TypeScript interfaces for database schemas would help prevent runtime errors.
- `useQuiz` loads questions from a JSON file but lacks error handling if loading fails. Consider wrapping in try/catch.

## Server API
- The `/api/openai` endpoint logs the prompt to the console. Avoid logging sensitive data in production.
- Error handling in `/api/openai` is minimal. Returning proper HTTP status codes would help the client handle failures.
- The `/api/login` endpoint returns a fake token but sets it as a cookie. Ensure security attributes (`secure`, `httpOnly`) are correctly configured when deploying.

## Pages/SQL Logic
- `pages/sql/[[id]].vue` contains complex logic for executing user SQL and comparing results. Splitting this logic into composables would improve maintainability.
- Functions like `executeUserSQL` and `executeAnswerSQL` rely on side effects. Returning values instead of mutating state would make them easier to test.

## Miscellaneous
- There are HTML files under `developmentKit/` used for generating tables. If not required for the app itself, consider moving them out of the main source tree.
- The README describes the project well but could include steps for setting environment variables (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
